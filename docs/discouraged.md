## Avoid Getting Discouraged

---

This is perhaps my most important advice. The job hunt sucks. You just have to accept that you are going to be Sisyphus pushing that boulder up a hill. The good thing though is that it will end eventually. No matter how disheartening the process is, you have to stick with it. Don't let a week of zero responses stop you from trying again the next week.

Every single week you need to be doing something towards landing a job. Definitely apply to a minimum 20 jobs a week if you want to maximize your odds. There's about 1,000 other things that will help your odds with landing a job, whether it be Github projects, reading a book on it, Leetcode, editing your resume, preparing for potential interviews, ect. Just dedicate a certain amount of hours each week and work on some of them.

I know it's difficult focusing and dedicating time to things like that when you're already just trying to graduate. I was only doing 9 credit hours my final semester and I felt beaten down. It's super important to stick with it though and stay consistent.

Starting before graduation is one of the best things you can do. I know some people that started from zero after graduation and they're having a ROUGH time. Even if in the worst case you don't land anything before you walk the stage, you're so far ahead of the curve.

Some absolute hooligans land jobs. Even if you're not really qualified for the position, people do not enjoy interviewing and looking for an employee so they might just give up and accept you. This is just to state that anyone graduating with a CS degree is capable of landing a job.
