## Applying to Positions

---

### When to Apply

You should start applying as soon as possible. If you start applying for positions, the beginning of senior year, it will probably be a lot slower that first semester compared to your last semester.

A common issue I ran into when applying super early on is during the interview I told them I would not be able to start working for four months as I had to graduate first. A lot of them were looking for someone to hire ASAP so I did not get that position.

That being said, it is still advantageous to start applying quite early.

### Where to Apply

For where you should apply, like what websites, [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com) worked best for me. People will warn you about quick apply, since it's so fast and easy to apply there's a lot more competition. Even though your odds are low, when it takes one minute to apply, why not? I landed my job from a quick apply. That being said, you also want to put some effort into applications that take time. It's super important you're fast at applying because you will want to apply as much as possible.

The website [https://www.builtinaustin.com/](https://www.builtinaustin.com/) is another place where I had pretty good luck.

[Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/) Didn't work great for me so I gave up on using it. You might have better luck.

For me personally, I wanted to stack every advantage I could in my favor so I applied all over the U.S. That's going to be a conversation you need to have with yourself if you're willing to leave everything behind. It worked out fantastic for me, but it won't for everyone.

I followed somewhat of a shotgun approach in applying for jobs. I applied to pretty much everything I was half qualified for. By the way, Ignore most job requirements. Of course, if it's asking for 10 years experience with a Doctorite, then you're not qualified for that position. That being said, you will almost never be 100% qualified based on their requirements

For any undergrad reading this. If you want to apply to [Visa](https://usa.visa.com/) reach out to me personally if you want a referal. I do not have enough clout to get you an interview, but I get a couple grand if I'm your reference and you land the job so please reach out to me.

Lastly, apply to mostly New Grad positions. Entry level isn't really entry level and very few undergrad students are actually qualified for entry level. That doesn't mean don't apply to entry level, just mostly apply to new grad. This is one of the benefits of applying sonner rather than later so do not give up.
