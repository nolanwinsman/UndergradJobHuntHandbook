## Applying to Positions

## When to Apply

You should start applying as soon as possible. If you start applying for positions, the beginning of senior year, it will probably be a lot slower that first semester compared to your last semester.

A common issue I ran into when applying super early on is during the interview I told them I would not be able to start working for four months as I had to graduate first. A lot of them were looking for someone to hire ASAP so I did not get that position.

That being said, it is still advantageous to start applying quite early.

## Where to Apply

For where you should apply, like what websites, [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com) worked best for me. People will warn you about quick apply, since it's so fast and easy to apply there's a lot more competition. Even though your odds are low, when it takes one minute to apply, why not? I landed my job from a quick apply. That being said, you also want to put some effort into applications that take time. It's super important you're fast at applying because you will want to apply as much as possible.

The website [https://www.builtinaustin.com/](https://www.builtinaustin.com/) is another place where I had pretty good luck.

[Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/) Didn't work great for me so I gave up on using it. You might have better luck.

For me personally, I wanted to stack every advantage I could in my favor so I applied all over the U.S. That's going to be a conversation you need to have with yourself if you're willing to leave everything behind. It worked out fantastic for me, but it won't for everyone.

I followed somewhat of a shotgun approach in applying for jobs. I applied to pretty much everything I was half qualified for. By the way, Ignore most job requirements. Of course, if it's asking for 10 years experience with a Doctorite, then you're not qualified for that position. That being said, you will almost never be 100% qualified based on their requirements

For any undergrad reading this. If you want to apply to [Visa](https://usa.visa.com/) reach out to me personally if you want a referal. I do not have enough clout to get you an interview, but I get a couple grand if I'm your reference and you land the job so please reach out to me.

Lastly, apply to mostly New Grad positions. Entry level isn't really entry level and very few undergrad students are actually qualified for entry level. That doesn't mean don't apply to entry level, just mostly apply to new grad. This is one of the benefits of applying sonner rather than later so do not give up.

## Apply as Early as Possible

Here's a little story; Recently, my adjacent team was hiring for a Senior Systems Engineer position. The position opened up early January and I sent it to a few of my friends to apply to. None of them applied. One week later recruiting picked out ten-ish people to
do a first round interview. The next week three of them had technical interviews. The week after that one of those three was sent an offer letter and she accepted. One of my friends eventually applied three weeks after I sent that individual the position but by that
point, they weren't looking anymore. The moral of the story is that typically teams are looking for the first great candidate, not the best candidate in the world.

A decent amount of the time a position is filled quite fast. You could be an amazing fit but there's a good chance they already found someone. This is why checking every day for new positions is so important. Now all of this is not to discourage you from applying to a
position if it's already been listed for a few weeks. It's just that your odds are much higher the earlier you apply.

## Integration Hell

For those that do not know what integration hell is, here's a little story. Imagine you're a civil engineer tasked with building a bridge. You spend night and day perfectly planning this out. You pick the best materials, your blueprints have accounted for all possible
scenarios. After months of planning your crew starts building the bridge. Immediately, you run into tons of issues. The material is weaker than you expected, crew get sick, the design looks ugly in person, basically everything that can go wrong does go wrong. This is
integration hell.

## Cold Emailing

A decent strategy for landing an internship is just emailing random people/companies. This mainly works with startups. I doubt you would be successful in emailing the CEO of a fortune 500 company about an internship but I guess it doesn't hurt to try. One thing
I want to point out is your approach in wording this email. A lot of people are kind of just asking for an internship and while this can work, I you can do a lot better.

For instance, imagine if a stranger emailed you asking for $100. You would probably just ignore the email as why would you just give someone you don't know $100. Now imagine if a stranger emails you a $100 giftcard. Ignoring the fact that you would probably
think this is a scam, can you see how one approach works far better than the other?

To make another example, I have had a lot of SU undergrads reach out to me for help over the years with their resume, applications, ect. I am happy to help because my upperclassmen helped me a ton so I feel it's warranted to help the youth of computer science at SU. Now
if a total stranger from a different university asked me to review their resume, the answer would most likely be **No**. Now if they offered to buy me a beer or send me manga, that's a different story.

Reading back what I wrote it sounds like I'm trying to say you should bribe people, and that's not the case at all. When you "cold" email someone about getting a potential internship, you need to frame it as what you bring to the table. If I owned a company and someone said
talked about their fantastic web development skills and how they can help improve my website or something like that, I'm 100 times more likely to get back to them or eventually give them an internship.
