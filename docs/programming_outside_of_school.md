## Programming Outside of School

---

Some people seem to say you need to grind programming outside of your classes. I don't think this is the case at all, but doing a bit of coding outside of school can have massive benefits and is one of the best ways to stand out from other applicants.
As for what programming you should work on, that's really up to you. I do not recommend picking super difficult and time consuming projects. For instance, while a 100 hour project that does some advanced analysis of something displays it on a website would be impressive, the average student is either going to give up, or not finish the project in time to put on your resume or discuss in interviews.

The best programming you can do outside of school is whatever interests you and you actually commit to doing. For me, I wrote a ton of [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Shell](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-what-is-shell.htm) scripts to automate random things. This is the programming I enjoyed. Sure it might have been more beneficial to learn another language, but I really enjoyed writing [Python](https://www.python.org/).

### Project Ideas

If you do strictly want to program whatever looks most impressive on your resume (I do not recommend this), then here are a few things you can do.

- Build a website (If this is your first time doing any web development, keep it simple. A website can be a great project since it's easy to show off. During an interview, they can just open the link and see your website. Web development is also the most common developer position availible so if you strictly want to make it easier to find work, this is a great route.)
- Python Web Scraping/APIs (As mentioned above, Project 8 of Programming Languages is quite important in my eyes. You would essentially be doing that project, but instead of fetching data from Wikipedia, you would fetch it somewhere else. I love movies so I did a lot of programs where I fetch data from [IMDB](https://developer.imdb.com/documentation/api-documentation/) and do something with that data)
- Automate the Onboarding Process of Getting a New Computer (This is one of my favorite projects. The title I gave is a bit confusing, but essentially you write a script that installs/configures all your software for your computer. So if you got a brand new computer, you would run this script and it would install Discord, Google Chrome, VSCode, ect.)
- If there's some Development field you want to get into then do a project that reflects that. Some obvious examples are, if you want to be a web developer, build a website. If you want to get into AI, build an AI that does something. This might require you to ask around for less obvious fields, like "what kind of programming do IT developers do?"

As a hard rule you should follow, ALL code you write outside of class should be on Github with proper **README** documentation. If it isn't an honor code violation, put it on Github. You solve a leetcode problem, put it on Github. You test something out in a new language, put it on Github. If you remember for Programming Languages you had to make frequent commits, get in the habit of doing that. You can see on my Github https://github.com/nolanwinsman I have a lot of green squares which look good. If you did do a longer project and it has two commits, that's wasted potential.

Also, a lot of people talk about the Leetcode grind. I really wouldn't suggest grinding it, maybe try a problem or two and watch a few youtube videos. For developer positions, you will sometimes be asked to solve a coding problem during the interview. This is one of the things that just sucks about the job hunt. One time I froze during a problem and promptly did not receive an invite to another interview. Just do your best and don't linger on any failures too much.
