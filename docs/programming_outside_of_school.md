# Programming Outside of School

I am a big believer that you need to do some amount of programming outside of your classes. I don't think you need to do 1000+ Leetcode questions and build six full stack applications, but you need to do something. Even if you make straight A's in all your classes,
if you graduate with zero extra coding done, you're gonna have a difficult time finding a job.

## Find the Fun in Programming

Some people seem to say you need to grind programming outside of your classes. I don't think this is the case at all, but doing a bit of coding outside of school can have massive benefits and is one of the best ways to stand out from other applicants.
As for what programming you should work on, that's really up to you. I do not recommend picking super difficult and time consuming projects. For instance, while a 100 hour project that does some advanced analysis of something displays it on a website would
be impressive, the average student is either going to give up, or not finish the project in time to put on your resume or discuss in interviews.

For me, I tried my best to find the fun in programming. I did what I enjoyed and what I found intersting. For instance recently I have gotten into learning Neovim and customizing my nvim configuration. This has been such a blast and has reignited my excitedment
for development.

The best programming you can do outside of school is whatever interests you and you actually commit to doing. For me, I wrote a ton of [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Shell](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-what-is-shell.htm) scripts
to automate random things. This is the programming I enjoyed. Sure it might have been more beneficial to learn another language, but I really enjoyed writing [Python](https://www.python.org/). I remember an older classment told me I should do something new and different.
While there's a lot of value in that advice he gave me, I was just having so much fun with the development I was doing.

To really hammer in the point that I recommend coding what you find fun. One of my classmates spent probably 1000+ hours developing Minecraft mods. There's an argument that he could have spent that time doing more "corporate" development, he did what he enjoyed and
he's one of the best programmers I know.

## What Development to do Outside of School to Increase your Hireability

Okay so I know I just went on a massive rant that you should do whatever programming is most fun for you, there is also an argument for developing more corporate and hireable skills. One thing I notice somewhat commonly with undergrads is they fixate on learning things
that probably aren't worth their time. For instance, let's say you type at an average speed. You think to yourself "programmers code super fast. I should focus on typing faster." So you spend your freetime grinding [SpongeBob SquarePants Typing](https://spongebob.fandom.com/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants_Typing)
and [Typing of the Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Typing_of_the_Dead). Now if you think playing these games and typing faster is a ton of fun then go for it, but if you think it will increase the odds you'll get hired, you're playing yourself. A wise
professor once told me "You spend more time thinking than programming."

It could be worthwile to learn something that's useful to people like webdev, database, backend, game development, automated testing. Things that might not be the most exciting to learn on your own but make you a valuable assset.

## Project Ideas

If you do strictly want to program whatever looks most impressive on your resume (I do not recommend this), then here are a few things you can do.

- Build a website (If this is your first time doing any web development, keep it simple. A website can be a great project since it's easy to show off. During an interview, they can just open the link and see your website. Web development is also the most common developer position availible so if you strictly want to make it easier to find work, this is a great route.)
- Python Web Scraping/APIs (As mentioned above, Project 8 of Programming Languages is quite important in my eyes. You would essentially be doing that project, but instead of fetching data from Wikipedia, you would fetch it somewhere else. I love movies so I did a lot of programs where I fetch data from [IMDB](https://developer.imdb.com/documentation/api-documentation/) and do something with that data)
- Automate the Onboarding Process of Getting a New Computer (This is one of my favorite projects. The title I gave is a bit confusing, but essentially you write a script that installs/configures all your software for your computer. So if you got a brand new computer, you would run this script and it would install Discord, Google Chrome, VSCode, ect.)
- If there's some Development field you want to get into then do a project that reflects that. Some obvious examples are, if you want to be a web developer, build a website. If you want to get into AI, build an AI that does something. This might require you to ask around for less obvious fields, like "what kind of programming do IT developers do?"

As a hard rule you should follow, ALL code you write outside of class should be on Github with proper **README** documentation. If it isn't an honor code violation, put it on Github. You solve a leetcode problem, put it on Github. You test something out in a new language, put it on Github. If you remember for Programming Languages you had to make frequent commits, get in the habit of doing that. You can see on my Github https://github.com/nolanwinsman I have a lot of green squares which look good. If you did do a longer project and it has two commits, that's wasted potential.

Also, a lot of people talk about the Leetcode grind. I really wouldn't suggest grinding it, maybe try a problem or two and watch a few youtube videos. For developer positions, you will sometimes be asked to solve a coding problem during the interview. This is one of the things that just sucks about the job hunt. One time I froze during a problem and promptly did not receive an invite to another interview. Just do your best and don't linger on any failures too much.

## Programming Outside of School Makes your Schoolwork Easier

One benefit of doing some amount of coding outside of school is that it makes schoolwork easier. As an example, a decent number of students first exposure to Python at SU is the AI class. They're struggling with these AI projects because they're trying to learn
these complex AI concepts. At the same time they're also struggling to learn Python. It's a wombo combo of not understanding how to complete the AI projects. Since I had a strong background in Python, at no point did I struggle with those AI projects due to my lack of Python
knowledge.

But of a long winded example above but you should get the point. Around Sophomore/Junior year when I started coding here and there in my free time, programming became so much easier. A lot of the classwork just made more sense to me and my grades rapidly improved.
