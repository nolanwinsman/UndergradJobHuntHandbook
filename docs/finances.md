# Finances as an Adult

For me my outlook on finances changed a lot when I graduated college. It's imperitive that you aren't meek about these things and you develop financial literacy as the world will walk all over you if you don't.

## Please Don't Buy an Expensive Car

This is a short piece of advice but just please don't buy a stupid expensive car. The number of peers I have that balled out on a car as soon as they landed a tech job is a lot. Just because you can afford something doesn't mean you should.

## Get a Roommate

I assume most of ya'll reading this have either lived with family or roommates your entire life. Most of you are probably excited to be on your own for the first time in your lives. That being said, you should heavily consider getting a roommate.

Having a roommate is zero question one of the easiest ways to save a ton of money. Let me break down the finances of my housing situation when I graduated college and moved to Colorado for this job. I started out in a one bedroom apartment where the base rent was $1,700
a month. After a year living here I transfered to a two bedroom apartment in the exact same complex where the rent is $2,000 that I split evenly with my roommate. That saves me about $700 a month. Probably a bit over $800 a month including utilities. So around $10,000 a
year of savings for having a roommate. Other than a large promotion there's not much else you can do to somewhat easily save $10,000 a year.

Whoever said "mo money mo problems" is a hooligan because the more money I get the easier my life is generally speaking. With $10,000 extra a year you could buy that stupid car (I wouldn't recommend this still). You can save for a house much easier. You can gamble that
money on Counter Strike skins. You can invest that money. There's just so many things you can do with $10,000 a year. Your savings might not be exactly like mine but you should save at least several hundreds of dollars with one roommate.

## Investing

I know investing might seem scary or something you just told yourself you'll do when you're older but I HIGHLY recommend you start today. At the very least, start as soon as you get one of them real adult jobs. If for whatever reason you're anti investing, I want to give
some examples and hopefully persuade you to at least consider changing your mind.

Can we at the very least agree that setting aside some cash is a good idea. I have had friends laid off or they have to abruptly quit their job due to family reasons; Life happens. Having some kind of emergency savings is a fantastic idea and can really protect you
when things hit the fan. Now the issue comes up when you have over a years cash emergency savings. Do you just keep adding cash to that emergency savings account? That cash isn't doing anything for you.

For a simple example let's say you're making good money and able to save $7,000 a year. If you saved $7,000 a year every year from age 24 to 60, you would end up with $252,000. Not a bad amount but not enough to retire. Now let's say you put that $7,000 into an account that
generated 4% interest for you compounding each year. To be clear, 4% is an EXTREMELY modest number. That's basically [T-Bill and Chilling](https://www.morningstar.com/portfolios/should-you-t-bill-chill)
You can easily get up to 7%-10% with simple index funds. But for now let's go with 4%. So After 36 years at age 60 you would have $564,915.72 more than double the amount
with zero interest. Just to give the number for 7% interest, you would have $1,115,361.81. Over ONE MILLION DOLLARS. I highly recommend you play around with an [Interest Calculator](https://www.calculator.net/interest-calculator.html?cstartingprinciple=0&cannualaddition=7%2C000&cmonthlyaddition=0&cadditionat1=beginning&cinterestrate=7&ccompound=annually&cyears=36&cmonths=0&ctaxtrate=0&cinflationrate=3&printit=0&x=Calculate#interestresults)
and you see what kind of money you can end up with

Now you don't have to invest exactly $7,000 a year and follow all this exactly. Maybe you only make enough to put $1,000 a year or you're so broke you can only do $5 a month. Whatever you put into investing is what you get out of it so I highly recommend you start
today by investing just a couple of dollars. I'm not going to lie and say a few dollars a month will compound into enough money to retire, but it's all relative.

## Ask for more Money

I am going to give a piece of advice that 95% of ya'll will not follow. Ask for more money. I feel like people make excuses not to ask for more money more than anything in the world. It's such simple advice yet most people won't follow it because they're scared.

In the 1940s elevator operators went on strike to get more pay. This worked and they all got paid a decent amount more. A few years later they went on strike again and then they were promptly replaced with automatic elevators. This story is a little misleading as
they weren't instantly replaced with automatic elevators. Getting more money is all about your leverage and how you use it.

For when to ask for more money, obviously once you've gotten an offer letter. Don't be negotiating it in the first interview. I thought I was mentally prepared to ask for more money but when they gave me the initial offer it was far more than I expected and I got
nervous about asking for more. Let's say you're a new grad that just got an offer at my company and you ask for an increase in the salary. What do you think will happen? Most likely you won't be able to increase your salary BUT, they will almost certainly increase your
sign on bonus by $5,000. I could have had an extra $5,000 in my pocket if I just asked.

Now with asking for more money, you don't even need to do it in person or on the phone. You can just send it in an email before accepting your offer letter. I want ya'll to think of this like rejection therapy. Be prepared to ask for more money even if you're scared of
being rejected.

A lot of people have asked me questions along the lines of how much can the company pay me? The short answer is almost always more than they're offering.

## Benefits Matter

Something that was in the back of my mind but not really a forefront thought was benefits at whatever company I ended up working at. I was mainly concerned about the salary and location. There's nothing wrong with being fixated on salary as that is an extremely
important factor on whether or not you should take a job, but benefits are almost as important. There's a lot of benefits that I didn't know or didn't really care about that matter a lot so I want to list them with some information around them. These things
should also be factors in whether or not you take a job. It's also important to ask about benefits during the interview phase.

#### Remote/Hybrid Work

In my opinion, some amount of remote hybrid work is a must unless the job absolutely requires you to be in office. Like if you get a job working on a server room where all your work is physical and tangible, then remote work is kind of impossible. Other than that I think
any tech company must give their workers at least a day or two to work remotely. I personally prefer hybrid work. While it's a bit annoying having to drive to the office I enjoy talking with my coworkers, fun social events and hanging out with the friends I've made. I
also usually lift at the gym. With that being said, there's still a lot of heads down focus on my computer time. It's nice to be able to do that at home and have less distractions. I also get to blast my music which helps me code faster than anyone's coded before.

I remember thinking I just wanted a job so bad I would take a full time in office role. Looking back I'm so glad I didn't have to. If you get offered a position but they require a full 9:00 to 5:00 Monday through Friday in the office you need to seriously
consider if this is something you desperately need.
