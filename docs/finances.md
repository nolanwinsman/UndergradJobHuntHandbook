## Please Don't Buy an Expensive Car

This is a short piece of advice but just please don't buy a stupid expensive car. The number of peers I have that balled out on a car as soon as they landed a tech job is a lot. Just because you can afford something doesn't mean you should.

## Get a Roommate

I assume most of ya'll reading this have either lived with family or roommates your entire life. Most of you are probably excited to be on your own for the first time in your lives. That being said, you should heavily consider getting a roommate.

Having a roommate is zero question one of the easiest ways to save a ton of money. Let me break down the finances of my housing situation when I graduated college and moved to Colorado for this job. I started out in a one bedroom apartment where the base rent was $1,700
a month. After a year living here I transfered to a two bedroom apartment in the exact same complex where the rent is $2,000 that I split evenly with my roommate. That saves me about $700 a month. Probably a bit over $800 a month including utilities. So around $10,000 a
year of savings for having a roommate. Other than a large promotion there's not much else you can do to somewhat easily save $10,000 a year.

Whoever said "mo money mo problems" is a hooligan because the more money I get the easier my life is generally speaking. With $10,000 extra a year you could buy that stupid car (I wouldn't recommend this still). You can save for a house much easier. You can gamble that
money on Counter Strike skins. You can invest that money. There's just so many things you can do with $10,000 a year. Your savings might not be exactly like mine but you should save at least several hundreds of dollars with one roommate.
