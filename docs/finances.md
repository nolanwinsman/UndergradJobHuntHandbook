## Please Don't Buy an Expensive Car

This is a short piece of advice but just please don't buy a stupid expensive car. The number of peers I have that balled out on a car as soon as they landed a tech job is a lot. Just because you can afford something doesn't mean you should.

## Get a Roommate

I assume most of ya'll reading this have either lived with family or roommates your entire life. Most of you are probably excited to be on your own for the first time in your lives. That being said, you should heavily consider getting a roommate.

Having a roommate is zero question one of the easiest ways to save a ton of money. Let me break down the finances of my housing situation when I graduated college and moved to Colorado for this job. I started out in a one bedroom apartment where the base rent was $1,700
a month. After a year living here I transfered to a two bedroom apartment in the exact same complex where the rent is $2,000 that I split evenly with my roommate. That saves me about $700 a month. Probably a bit over $800 a month including utilities. So around $10,000 a
year of savings for having a roommate. Other than a large promotion there's not much else you can do to somewhat easily save $10,000 a year.

Whoever said "mo money mo problems" is a hooligan because the more money I get the easier my life is generally speaking. With $10,000 extra a year you could buy that stupid car (I wouldn't recommend this still). You can save for a house much easier. You can gamble that
money on Counter Strike skins. You can invest that money. There's just so many things you can do with $10,000 a year. Your savings might not be exactly like mine but you should save at least several hundreds of dollars with one roommate.

## Ask for more Money

I am going to give a piece of advice that 95% of ya'll will not follow. Ask for more money. I feel like people make excuses not to ask for more money more than anything in the world. It's such simple advice yet most people won't follow it because they're scared.

In the 1940s elevator operators went on strike to get more pay. This worked and they all got paid a decent amount more. A few years later they went on strike again and then they were promptly replaced with automatic elevators. This story is a little misleading as
they weren't instantly replaced with automatic elevators. Getting more money is all about your leverage and how you use it.

For when to ask for more money, obviously once you've gotten an offer letter. Don't be negotiating it in the first interview. I thought I was mentally prepared to ask for more money but when they gave me the initial offer it was far more than I expected and I got
nervous about asking for more. Let's say you're a new grad that just got an offer at my company and you ask for an increase in the salary. What do you think will happen? Most likely you won't be able to increase your salary BUT, they will almost certainly increase your
sign on bonus by $5,000. I could have had an extra $5,000 in my pocket if I just asked.

Now with asking for more money, you don't even need to do it in person or on the phone. You can just send it in an email before accepting your offer letter. I want ya'll to think of this like rejection therapy. Be prepared to ask for more money even if you're scared of
being rejected.

A lot of people have asked me questions along the lines of how much can the company pay me? The short answer is almost always more than they're offering.
