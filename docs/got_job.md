# Tips for Once You've Actually Started the Job

## Be Useful

The biggest piece of advice I can give to any new hire for a new grad position or internship, is to find a way to be useful.

## Document Document Document

Documentation is so much more than just code comments. There are so many different things and ways you should be documenting, here are just some examples. Documenting is also a fantastic way to stand out as most people do the bare minimum. Below are just some examples
of documentation that you should consider doing.

### Documenting Your Repos

You need to go sicko mode on your README. I would grab a template and make sure your README has these below things

- What is this code
- How to install it
- How to run it
- Overview of every relevant file
- Who contributed to this code

And more.
