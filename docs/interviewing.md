## Interviewing

---

Interviewing is a skill that takes practice. Some people go in thinking they're sociable and don't need to worry about the interview. These people are usually incorrect. I'll list a few of the things I learned below.

Focus on being likeable. This is perhaps the most important aspect of interviewing. Usually, you are going to be interviewed by the people you will work with if you land the job. Sometimes there's a first interview with a recruiter or something, but at some point in the interview process, this is usually the case. They're looking for someone they're going to sit next to and work with for potentially years. I'm sure you've met someone before where in the first minute of conversation you tell yourself, "I don't want to be around this person." You want to give off the opposite. Do your best to not be nervous, smile, make good conversation.

### Answering Questions

Be prepared for some of the same questions over and over. There are some classic interview questions that you might want to review and write down how you would respond. I only got asked "What's your greatest weakness" once, but similar generic questions will come up a lot. I'll list a few questions I remember getting below.

- Tell me a bit about yourself (This is probably the most common question I got and it's a bit jarring. I would just efficiently explain something like "My name is Nolan Winsman I'm a graduating senior at SU...I want to specialize in automation..." something like that)
- Tell us about a time you resolved a conflict (Maybe not exactly this question, but they want to hear how you deal with things going wrong, particularly with people.)
- Questions geared specifically about work experience and programming projects

### Asking Questions

Be prepared to ask questions. This is super important. At the end of almost every single interview, they are going to ask you if you have any questions. It is MONUMENTAL that you have some decent questions prepared. Since I was applying to so many positions, I would forget I applied to a company when I got an interview. Even if I remembered, I always looked at the company's website a bit. You want a basic idea of what they do. A lot of their websites do not effectively communicate what the company does so I usually asked what they did, but in that question, I would make sure it shows I did my homework. For instance, for one interview I asked something like "Hey, I was looking through your website and I'm still a bit confused as to what <company name> does. Do you guys create finance software or ...?"

It's also super important that you're asking questions to understand the position/company. While I love my job at Visa, the interview process was quite atrocious. When I got the job, I was told I have to move to Colorado in three weeks. I did not know I was going to have to move. Also, I had ZERO idea what the job would entail. Things worked out for me, but it's super important you ask a lot of questions.

Below are a few common questions I would ask.

- What does an average day look like? (This question is incredible. Really helps you understand what you will actually be doing)
- What is Software XYZ I've never heard of before. (If they list some framework on the job posting, ask about it if you're curious)
- Do you have any suggestions for a student trying to stand out in the job hunt?
- What stands out to you in a great employee
- Can you tell me a bit about how you landed your leadership positions and what it entails.(This was a great question to ask people that are managers of teams)

Anyway, you get the point. Asking questions is a must.
