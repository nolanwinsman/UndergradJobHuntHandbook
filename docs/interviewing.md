# Interviewing

Interviewing is a skill that takes practice. Some people go in thinking they're sociable and don't need to worry about the interview. These people are usually incorrect. I'll list a few of the things I learned below.

Focus on being likeable. This is perhaps the most important aspect of interviewing. Usually, you are going to be interviewed by the people you will work with if you land the job. Sometimes there's a first interview with a recruiter or something, but at some point in the interview process, this is usually the case. They're looking for someone they're going to sit next to and work with for potentially years. I'm sure you've met someone before where in the first minute of conversation you tell yourself, "I don't want to be around this person." You want to give off the opposite. Do your best to not be nervous, smile, make good conversation.

## Answering Questions

Be prepared for some of the same questions over and over. There are some classic interview questions that you might want to review and write down how you would respond. I only got asked "What's your greatest weakness" once, but similar generic questions will come up a lot. I'll list a few questions I remember getting below.

- **Tell me a bit about yourself** (This is probably the most common question I got and it's a bit jarring. I would just efficiently explain something like "My name is Nolan Winsman I'm a graduating senior at SU...I want to specialize in automation..." something like that)
- **Tell us about a time you resolved a conflict** (Maybe not exactly this question, but they want to hear how you deal with things going wrong, particularly with people.)
- Questions geared specifically about work experience and programming projects
- **What is your greatest weakness?** Now this question is a bit old school but you might get asked it. I was asked it once. To answer this you want to give an honest answer that doesn't make you look like a bad candidate. For me personally, I would answer this with
  something like "To be honest I'm not very good at remembering things over a long period of time. In particular tasks that I only need to complete every few months. I get around this by writing thorough documentation so when I forget, I have documents explaining how to
  complete the task." See this is a genuine weakness but I also explain how I work around this weakness. I have a friend that answers something like "I have difficulty waking up super early in the morning like before 7:00 A.M. I can do it but it's just unpleasant for me."
  It doesn't need to be the perfect well crafted answer. You're being interviewed by humans so they enjoy human responses. Now you don't want to answer something like "I have difficulty getting to work sober" or "I work too hard." These are awful answers. If you truly
  have no idea what to answer for this, you could answer something like "I'm new to the industry..."

## Asking Questions

Be prepared to ask questions. This is super important. At the end of almost every single interview, they are going to ask you if you have any questions. It is MONUMENTAL that you have some decent questions prepared. Since I was applying to so many positions, I would forget I applied to a company when I got an interview. Even if I remembered, I always looked at the company's website a bit. You want a basic idea of what they do. A lot of their websites do not effectively communicate what the company does so I usually asked what they did, but in that question, I would make sure it shows I did my homework. For instance, for one interview I asked something like "Hey, I was looking through your website and I'm still a bit confused as to what <company name> does. Do you guys create finance software or ...?"

It's also super important that you're asking questions to understand the position/company. While I love my job at Visa, the interview process was quite atrocious. When I got the job, I was told I have to move to Colorado in three weeks. I did not know I was going to have to move. Also, I had ZERO idea what the job would entail. Things worked out for me, but it's super important you ask a lot of questions.

Below are a few common questions I would ask.

- What does an average day look like? (This question is incredible. Really helps you understand what you will actually be doing)
- What is Software XYZ I've never heard of before. (If they list some framework on the job posting, ask about it if you're curious)
- Do you have any suggestions for a student trying to stand out in the job hunt?
- What stands out to you in a great employee
- Can you tell me a bit about how you landed your leadership positions and what it entails.(This was a great question to ask people that are managers of teams)

Anyway, you get the point. Asking questions is a must.

## Likeability

Now I want you to close your eyes and think of someone you just don't enjoy being around. It could be because they're annoying, they make you uncomftorable, they smell bad, whatever reason. Now think of someone you enjoy being around. It could be because they're funny,
they're kind and warm, they good listeners, whatever. Now of the two people you imagined, which would you rather work with? Coming across as a likeable person during the interview is important. Of course they're looking for someone competent, they're also looking for
someone they're going to have to sit next to for a few years. Now I don't really know techniques for coming across as a likeable person. I'm not always the best at it myself, but one important thing you can do is smile.

## Don't be Yes Man like the Hit 2008 movie starring Jim Carrey

After a couple dozen or hundred rejections, it's pretty easy to just say yes to everything in an interview.

- Are you willing to work weekends? **"Yes"**
- Can you work more than 60 hours a week? **"Yes"**
- Do you enjoy Frontend development? **"Yes"** (you secretly despise Frontend development)
- Will you stop watching anime for this position? **"Yes"**

Now you don't want to just say "No" to everything but don't let these interviewers walk all over you. You'll probably reach a point where you just want any job and that's understandable but you really should hold your ground to some degree. If it's a job you're almost
certain you'll be miserable in then don't take it. Life has a way of working out. Future opportunities will come.

## Snow Lands on Top

The simplest explanation for this is that you need to be confident. I understand when programming is still quite confusing and you don't really have tech work experience it can be difficult to have confidence. That being said you need to find some confidence
somewhere. If I'm interviewing you and you're not confident in yourself, then why should I be confident in you? I believe the below section **Filling a Role** covers some change in perspectives you can have to increase your confidence. Other things you can do is just
practice programming or put more effort into classes. Build cool things. During my senior year when applying to jobs I knew I wouldn't be a superstar programmer but I truly believed I could contribute to the success of a team. This belief in myself helped immensely.

## Filling a Role

A lot of people seem to think they need to be the Messiah of Programming to get hired. Their prescient visions show them the golden path to the perfect solution for any coding problem. This just isn't the case, especially for intern/new grad roles. They're looking for
someone that can fill a particular role. For instance, I am great at my role; I'm great at finding ways to automate things and actually writing scripts to make it happen. I'm fantastic at documenting; I have a strong general computer competency, ect. This is the role I
fulfil at my current company. Now there's many developer positions that are roles that I am not great at.

Back in college I interviewed for a position as an Android App Developer. After the first interview, I was rejected. Being rejected is never fun but I didn't take it personally, they're looking for a specific role and I did not fit that role. Humans are amalgamations of
different competencies. It's all about figuring out where you fit in and how you can provide.
