# Resume

In my opinion, a lot of people underestimate how time consuming and difficult it is to build a strong resume. It can take months of refinement and editing to have an excellent resume. This is why the sooner you start the better.

## Adding Stuff to your Resume when you lack Experience

One of the most difficult aspects of building a good resume as an undergrad is having enough experience to fill out one page. Here are a few things you can do to add experience for your resume.

- Teach yourself a programming language. You do not have to become a master at the language. In my opinion, if you can program Dr. Schrum's Programming Languages Project 1 Java Overview(The one where you have to do like six tasks to learn the language) in another language like [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) or [Lua](https://www.lua.org/), then you know enough to put it on your resume.
- Teach yourself [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). It takes maybe 30 minutes to understand 90% or Markdown, you've probably used it before on your projects README. This document is written in MARKDOWN.
- Join a club at school. To be honest this won't be a massive benefit to your resume, but it does look good and fill out some space.
- Get a job. If you're about to graduate, it might be too late. For pretty much everyone else, if you've never had a normal job, you should get one. A single _grunt work_ job looks ingredible on your resume. For me I worked at a Golf Course and put that on my resume. If you're worried about time commitment, get a summer job or an on campus job.

## Projects

You should probably have a projects section to your resume if you're applying to any position that involves writing code. If you haven't coded a second outside of school, here are a list of projects that you should have done at SU as a CS major that display competency. Pretty much any of the cool sounding projects will be impressive on your resume. Just make sure you remember most the details of what the problem was and how you solved it because you will be asked about it in interviews.

- **Capstone** (Your capstone project is an amazing asset to add to your resume)
- **AI Final Project** (If you have taken Dr. Schrum's AI class, the final project is another excellent asset to add to your resume. One of the benefits is more than likely you can publish the code for this publicly on your [Github](https://github.com/))
- **Programming Languages Project 8 Wikipedia Web Scraping** (This is probably the best standard project to add to your resume. A ton of programming in the corporate world is fetch this data, do something with the data, then display it somewhere else)

## One Page

This is a simple rule. Your resume absolutely cannot be more than one page. I do not care if you won six Nobel Peace Prizes, do not make your resume more than one page. If you have to cut stuff, that's a good problem to have.

## Formatting

There are many perspectives and opinions on how your resume should look. The only hard rule I believe in is that your resume should not exceed one page. This is monumental. If your resume exceeds one page, change that ASAP.

Below are a list of things that I believe are important to the resume, but might not apply to every single individual.

- Find a good template. You can create your own template if you have an eye for design, but I think it's easiest to just use an online template. Just make sure whatever website you use doesn't try to Nickel and Dime you. For my resume, I use [flowcv](https://app.flowcv.com/). You can also find some great [LaTex](https://www.overleaf.com/) templates if you want complete control.
- For me personally, I like a hint of color. Nothing crazy, but more than black and white. A few greys or business blues can really make it pop while still looking sharp. The colors still need to be a blit bland though, no pinks or oranges' ect.
- You cannot have any gramatical errors
- Do everything the same way. For instance, if one time I list the time I worked at a job as 2019/06 (year/month) but somewhere else for another job I list 08/2020 (month/year) then that looks bad. Follow this perfectly, if you have a - (dash space) and somewhere else you have - (dash space space) don't do that.

## General Resume Advice

This advice will be true of a lot of the job hunt process, but really try to put yourself in their shows. They're combing through hundreds of resumes that are all kind of the same. They're going to skim yours for two minutes. Because of this, you really want something that will draw their interest. This is why you want to organize your resume where the most interesting stuff is towards the top and the least interesting stuff is towards the bottom (meaning your work experience does not have to be chronological).

Some people give the advice of having multiple resumes or editing your resume for each position you apply to. While this certainly will improve your odds. As an undergrad, it's rare to have enough experience for multiple resumes. If you've really trying to make it into two different fields you might want one resume for each. For instance one resume has your web development stuff and another resume has your database management stuff.

As for cover letters, I think they're a waste of time for undergrads. If you can make one cover letter that only takes a few minutes to edit per position then that's fine. Just always be aware, if you're frequently spending more than 30 minutes applying to each position something is wrong.

One of the best ways to improve your resume is letting other people review it. My CS professors gave me some of the best advice towards my resume. It is also important to have many other people review your resume. People like upperclassmen currently working in tech, current/former bosses, and pretty much anyone who's willing. Make sure to have at least one person outside of SU review your resume, and one person outside of the tech scene.

One common issue I see on resumes is how people communicate what they did at their job or what their projects involved. It should be bullet points starting with action words that quickly convey what the problem is and how you solved it. There should also be points that describe teamwork/collaboration to some degree if possible.

## Review Other People's Resumes

I have had a lot of undergrads over the years ask me to review their resumes. While I think this is a fantastic idea, I had my upperclassmen read over my resume many times, one thing that I've noticed is not a single undergrad has asked to look at my resume.
Maybe the arrogant side of me just wants to flex my resume, but I still think it's worthwhile to review other people's resumes. See what you like, what you don't like. Maybe you see something new. I previewed many of my upperclassmen's resumes back in my day. Not the
most important advice but something worth considering.

## Common Feedback I give on Resumes

#### oomph

I have seen a lot of decent to strong resumes that lack "oomph." The resume might be pretty good, but would it stand out in a stack of 100 resumes?

I would thoroughly go through every single bullet point and rewrite it many times. Every word needs to be carefully picked with intention. Kinda like poetry. Starting every bullet point with an impactful action word is important.

Action words like...

- Developed
- Coordinated
- Generated
- Wrote
- Designed
- Documented
- Assessed
- Implemented
- Produced
- Tested

ect.

Also avoid reusing action words and if you do reuse one, make sure it's not in close proximity to the previous instance. You don't want

- **Developed** Software to...
- Documented Test cases for...
- **Developed** Test Suite...

## What is the problem and How did you Fix it?

Sometimes when reading bullet points to projects and work you have no familiarity with it can be difficult to understand what the thing actually is. Some bullet points read like a list of tech words with no meaning. You don't have to follow this exactly, but I think some
description of what the code is and what it solves can be fantastic

## Github

You should list your Github on your resume and your Github needs to be at least decent.

Your Github cannot be bland. Not having a ton of commits isn't the end of the world, but you really should have a profile pick and a README profile. You can watch this video tutorial ![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9A8sQZDRn5o)
or look at my profile as reference. You don't have to copy the video or me exactly, but you should look at a lot oh profiles and see what you like. You definitely need to have some info there though. !()[https://github.com/nolanwinsman].
It looks a million times better if you spend some time to fill out your Github profile with some basic info about you, some stuff you're working on, and any other relevant information

Another important thing is somewhat frequent commits. The simple reality is monkey brain sees more green and things more betterer. I know some people use scripts to create 20+ fake commits a day but don't do that. You can somewhat inflate your commits number by committing
code far more often. Many moons ago I was a student in Dr. Schrum's "Programming Languages" class. This was the first class that I took that required Git commits and stored the code on Github. I would be willing to bet that no student before or after me has surpassed
me in total commits for the class. I think I averaged 40+ commits per project. The main reason I did this was because I wanted to build competency in committing a lot and not just coding the entire project then sending one commit for 'code finished.' This is a bit
of an overexplanation but you get my point, more commits are generally good.

Here are some things that I don't think I **must dos** but I still recommend.

- Have a good profile picuture of you.
- Have your Github account name be your full name (no `nolanTheJedi` account names).
- Star some interesting repositories.
- Follow people and have people follow you.
- Add widgets for things you want to show (I have wakatime since I think wakatime is really cool).

## More Numbers.

Try to add numbers to a lot/most of your bullet points. While numbers like...

- Wrote 1000+ lines of code...
- Pushed 200+ commits

Aren't a great heuristic for what you bring to the table, but it looks great on a resume and can make it easier for recruiters to understand how much work you did.

Numbers like

- Reduced computation time by 30%...
- Saved four hours a week...

Numbers like those are MONEY because when you do things that save time, that makes people MONEY.

## Filename

If you really want to go above and beyond you should `<Firstname Lastname> Resume <position applying to> <company applying to>.pdf` maybe not exactly like that but you get the point.

It can feel like this little bit of effort is a waste of time, but sometimes the small things are what eventually land you a job.
