# Networking

To be honest I don't know a ton about networking. This really isn't my area of expertise. That being said I do have a few tips

## You should have a LinkedIn

The spark notes of this piece of advice is make a LinkedIn, clean it up, add everyone you're familiar with. Recruiters love looking at your LinkedIn so it's important to have your job history up to date, a nice photo and some basic background information about you.

Back when I was 21, I made a LinkedIn and I searched up like ten of my classmates and added them. After this I checked LinkedIn every day and looked at the suggested connections sections and it was mostly people from my school. I sent a request to pretty much every face I
recognized.

It's also super important to do something similar to this when you start an internship. I made sure to add as many people I knew from my internship as possible. The main benefit being if I ever need to contact one of them again I can easily find them on LinkedIn.

If you're one of the few people reading this right now, you should add me on LinkedIn. I accept all my alma mater. It's advantageous for me if you add me because five, ten, twenty years down the line I could be looking for a new job and you could be the one to give me a
recommendation at your company.

Some people suggest you should add as many people as possible. I don't want to say this is wrong advice but I personally wouldn't follow it. I try not to have too many connections on LinkedIn that are just people I've never heard of.
