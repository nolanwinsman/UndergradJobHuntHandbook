## Miscellaneous Advice

---

This is mostly just advice I would give to people that just landed a position.

- Get your finances figured out. Most people have poor money management skills. Don't be like them. Live below your means to some degree.
- Learn how to invest your money. This is one of those things that will be the smartest choice you ever make and old you will be quite happy. I can't tell you what to invest in (you should open a ROTH IRA though) Just watch a lot of Youtube videos on it and dedicate some amount of money every month to go into investments.
- Reach out to a lot of people for advice. Reaching out to me is smart since I know what I'm talking about. I still reach out to a lot of family, friends, and former bosses for advice.
- Learn to cook for yourself. You might land a large tech salary. Don't be one of the people that spends a quarter of it on UberEats.
- The terminal is your friend. I know a lot of people avoid the terminal as much as possible when programming, but the more you use it, the more you realize how incredible it is. Get used to doing things in the terminal
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) is incredible. A majority of people will not enjoy writing their code in Neovim, but I love it. If you're willing to put in the time, you can become a lot faster at writing code.
- Focus on automating as much as possible. As you get older more and more responsibility will be thrown your way. With your computer skills, you should be able to automate a lot of it. Start simple by automating payments/bills and work your way up to automating as much as possible.
