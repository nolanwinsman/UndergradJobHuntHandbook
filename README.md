# Undergrad Job Hunt Handbook

---

I have had a few people reach out to me for general advice on the job hunt process so I decided to write a document that contains almost everything I know about the process.

This document is aimed towards graduating seniors at SU, but a lot of this advice applies to any undergrad student looking for a job or an internship.

This is all based on my personal experience so nobody should follow it exactly. You have to find what works best for you.

Some people have reached out to me and told me this document was useful to them. I'm not sure if they're just saying that to be nice which usually gets me to be more helpful to them, but I hope you find some use from this information.

## [Resume](docs/resume.md)

Explains all my thoughts on resumes. This section also covers your Github profile as most commonly that is linked on your Resume (at least it should be).

## [Programming Outside of School](docs/programming_outside_of_school.md)

## [Applying to Positions](docs/applying.md)

## [Interviewing](docs/interviewing.md)

## [Networking](docs/networking.md)

## [Avoid Getting Discouraged](docs/discouraged.md)

## [Internships](docs/internship.md)

## [What to Do Once You Actually Got the Job](docs/got_job.md)

## [Finances](docs/finances.md)

## [Getting Better at Coding and General Programming Advice](docs/getting_better_at_coding.md)

## [Miscellaneous Advice](docs/misc.md)

## Key Takeaways

- Resume building, interviewing, applying to jobs, and the overall job hunt are skills that take time to develop and that you need to develop.
- You have to do some amount of coding outside of classwork. Whether that's fun scripting, crafting video game mods, research, internships, leetcode, or whatever, you have to do something.
  Even if you finish school with a 4.0 GPA, if you've never done any coding outside of the cirriculum you're going to have a difficult time.
- Most students are so fixated on landing a job they don't really think about what to do once you actually got the job.
- You need to develop financial literacy

## Conclusion

---

Sorry if this is an overload of information. Just try to absorb what you can. Since a few people have asked me general job hunting advice, I put almost everything I know into this document.

My upperclassmen had my back so many times and I will never lose my appreciation for what they did so I want to help as much as I can.

Best of Luck!
