# UndergradJobHuntHandbook
---

I have had a few people reach out to me for general advice on the job hunt process so I decided to write a document that contains almost everything I know about the process. 

This document is aimed towards graduating seniors at SU, but a lot of this advice applies to any undergrad student looking for a job or an internship.

This is all based on my personal experience so nobody should follow it exactly. You have to find what works best for you.

## Resume
---
In my opinion, a lot of people underestimate how time consuming and difficult it is to build a strong resume. It can take months of refinement and editing to have an excellent resume. This is why the sooner you start the better.

### Adding Stuff to your Resume when you lack Experience

One of the most difficult aspects of building a good resume as an undergrad is having enough experience to fill out one page. Here are a few things you can do to add experience for your resume.

- Teach yourself a programming language. You do not have to become a master at the language. In my opinion, if you can program Dr. Schrum's Programming Languages Project 1 Java Overview(The one where you have to do like six tasks to learn the language) in another language like [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) or [Lua](https://www.lua.org/), then you know enough to put it on your resume.
- Teach yourself [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). It takes maybe 30 minutes to understand 90% or Markdown, you've probably used it before on your projects README. This document is written in MARKDOWN.
- Join a club at school. To be honest this won't be a massive benefit to your resume, but it does look good and fill out some space. 
- Get a job. If you're about to graduate, it might be too late. For pretty much everyone else, if you've never had a normal job, you should get one. A single *grunt work* job looks ingredible on your resume. For me I worked at a Golf Course and put that on my resume. If you're worried about time commitment, get a summer job or an on campus job.

#### Projects
---
You should probably have a projects section to your resume if you're applying to any position that involves writing code. If you haven't coded a second outside of school, here are a list of projects that you should have done at SU as a CS major that display competency. Pretty much any of the cool sounding projects will be impressive on your resume. Just make sure you remember most the details of what the problem was and how you solved it because you will be asked about it in interviews.

- **Capstone** (Your capstone project is an amazing asset to add to your resume)
- **AI Final Project** (If you have taken Dr. Schrum's AI class, the final project is another excellent asset to add to your resume. One of the benefits is more than likely you can publish the code for this publicly on your [Github](https://github.com/))
- **Programming Languages Project 8 Wikipedia Web Scraping** (This is probably the best standard project to add to your resume. A ton of programming in the corporate world is fetch this data, do something with the data, then display it somewhere else)

#### General Resume Advice

This advice will be true of a lot of the job hunt process, but really try to put yourself in their shows. They're combing through hundreds of resumes that are all kind of the same. They're going to skim yours for two minutes. Because of this, you really want something that will draw their interest. This is why you want to organize your resume where the most interesting stuff is towards the top and the least interesting stuff is towards the bottom (meaning your work experience does not have to be chronological).

Some people give the advice of having multiple resumes or editing your resume for each position you apply to. While this certainly will improve your odds. As an undergrad, it's rare to have enough experience for multiple resumes. If you've really trying to make it into two different fields you might want one resume for each. For instance one resume has your web development stuff and another resume has your database management stuff.

As for cover letters, I think they're a waste of time for undergrads. If you can make one cover letter that only takes a few minutes to edit per position then that's fine. Just always be aware, if you're frequently spending more than 30 minutes applying to each position something is wrong.

One of the best ways to improve your resume is letting other people review it. My CS professors gave me some of the best advice towards my resume. It is also important to have many other people review your resume. People like upperclassmen currently working in tech, current/former bosses, and pretty much anyone who's willing.

## Programming Outside of School
---

Some people seem to say you need to grind programming outside of your classes. I don't think this is the case at all, but doing a bit of coding outside of school can have massive benefits and is one of the best ways to stand out from other applicants.
As for what programming you should work on, that's really up to you. I do not recommend picking super difficult and time consuming projects. For instance, while a 100 hour project that does some advanced analysis of something displays it on a website would be impressive, the average student is either going to give up, or not finish the project in time to put on your resume or discuss in interviews.

The best programming you can do outside of school is whatever interests you and you actually commit to doing. For me, I wrote a ton of [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Shell](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-what-is-shell.htm) scripts to automate random things. This is the programming I enjoyed. Sure it might have been more beneficial to learn another language, but I really enjoyed writing [Python](https://www.python.org/). 

If you do strictly want to program whatever looks most impressive on your resume (I do not recommend this), then here are a few things you can do.

- Build a website (If this is your first time doing any web development, keep it simple. A website can be a great project since it's easy to show off. During an interview, they can just open the link and see your website. Web development is also the most common developer position availible so if you strictly want to make it easier to find work, this is a great route.)
- Python Web Scraping/APIs (As mentioned above, Project 8 of Programming Languages is quite important in my eyes. You would essentially be doing that project, but instead of fetching data from Wikipedia, you would fetch it somewhere else. I love movies so I did a lot of programs where I fetch data from [IMDB](https://developer.imdb.com/documentation/api-documentation/) and do something with that data)
- Automate the Onboarding Process of Getting a New Computer (This is one of my favorite projects. The title I gave is a bit confusing, but essentially you write a script that installs/configures all your software for your computer. So if you got a brand new computer, you would run this script and it would install Discord, Google Chrome, VSCode, ect.)
- If there's some Development field you want to get into then do a project that reflects what developers in that field do. Some obvious examples are, if you want to be a web developer, build a website. If you want to get into AI, build an AI that does something. This might require you to ask around for less obvious fields, like "what kind of programming do IT developers do?"

As a hard rule you should follow, ALL code you write outside of class should be on Github with proper **README** documentation. If it isn't an honor code violation, put it on Github. You solve a leetcode problem, put it on Github. You test something out in a new language, put it on Github. If you remember for Programming Languages you had to make frequent commits, get in the habit of doing that. You can see on my Github https://github.com/nolanwinsman I have a lot of green squares which look good. If you did do a longer project and it has two commits, that's wasted potential.

Also, a lot of people talk about the Leetcode grind. I really wouldn't suggest grinding it, maybe try a problem or two and watch a few youtube videos. For developer positions, you will sometimes be asked to solve a coding problem during the interview. This is one of the things that just sucks about the job hunt. One time I froze during a problem and promptly did not receive an invite to another interview. Just do your best and don't linger on any failures too much. 

## Applying to Positions
---

#### When to Apply

You should start applying as soon as possible. If you start applying for positions, the beginning of senior year, it will probably be a lot slower that first semester compared to your last semester.

A common issue I ran into when applying super early on is during the interview I told them I would not be able to start working for four months as I had to graduate first. A lot of them were looking for someone to hire ASAP so I did not get that position.

That being said, it is still advantageous to start applying quite early.  

#### Where to Apply

For where you should apply, like what websites, [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com) worked best for me. People will warn you about quick apply, since it's so fast and easy to apply there's a lot more competition. Even though your odds are low, when it takes one minute to apply, why not? I landed my job from a quick apply. That being said, you also want to put some effort into applications that take time. It's super important you're fast at applying because you will want to apply as much as possible.

The website [https://www.builtinaustin.com/](https://www.builtinaustin.com/) is another place where I had pretty good luck. 

[Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/) Didn't work great for me so I gave up on using it. You might have better luck.

For me personally, I wanted to stack every advantage I could in my favor so I applied all over the U.S. That's going to be a conversation you need to have with yourself if you're willing to leave everything behind. It worked out fantastic for me, but it won't for everyone.

For me personally, I followed somewhat of a shotgun approach in applying for jobs. I applied to pretty much everything I was half qualified for. By the way, Ignore most job requirements. Of course, if it's asking for 10 years experience with a Doctorite, then you're not qualified for that position. That being said, you will almost never be 100% qualified based on their requirements 

For any undergrad reading this. If you want to apply to [Visa](https://usa.visa.com/) reach out to me personally if you want a referal. I do not have enough clout to get you an interview, but I get a couple grand if I'm your reference and you land the job so please reach out to me.

Lastly, apply to mostly New Grad positions. Entry level isn't really entry level and very few undergrad students are actually qualified for entry level. That doesn't mean don't apply to entry level, just mostly apply to new grad. This is one of the benefits of applying sonner rather than later so do not give up.

## Interviewing
---
Interviewing is a skill that takes practice. Some people go in thinking they're sociable and don't need to worry about the interview. These people are usually incorrect. I'll list a few of the things I learned below.

Focus on being likeable. This is perhaps the most important aspect of interviewing. Usually, you are going to be interviewed by the people you will work with if you land the job. Sometimes there's a first interview with a recruiter or something, but at some point in the interview process, this is usually the case. They're looking for someone they're going to sit next to and work with for potentially years. I'm sure you've met someone before where in the first minute of conversation you tell yourself, "I don't want to be around this person." You want to give off the opposite. Do your best to not be nervous, smile, make good conversation.

#### Answering Questions

Be prepared for some of the same questions over and over. There are some classic interview questions that you might want to review and write down how you would respond. I only got asked "What's your greatest weakness" once, but similar generic questions will come up a lot. I'll list a few questions I remember getting below.

- Tell me a bit about yourself (This is probably the most common question I got and it's a bit jarring. I would just efficiently explain something like "My name is Nolan Winsman I'm a graduating senior at SU...I want to specialize in automation..." something like that)
- Tell us about a time you resolved a conflict (Maybe not exactly this question, but they want to hear how you deal with things going wrong, particularly with people.)
- Questions geared specifically about work experience and programming projects


#### Asking Questions

Be prepared to ask questions. This is super important. At the end of almost every single interview, they are going to ask you if you have any questions. It is MONUMENTAL that you have some decent questions prepared. Since I was applying to so many positions, I would forget I applied to a company when I got an interview. Even if I remembered, I always looked at the company's website a bit. You want a basic idea of what they do. A lot of their websites do not effectively communicate what the company does so I usually asked what they did, but in that question, I would make sure it shows I did my homework. For instance, for one interview I asked something like "Hey, I was looking through your website and I'm still a bit confused as to what <company name> does. Do you guys create finance software or ...?"

It's also super important that you're asking questions to understand the position/company. While I love my job at Visa, the interview process was quite atrocious. When I got the job, I was told I have to move to Colorado in three weeks. I did not know I was going to have to move. Also, I had ZERO idea what the job would entail. Things worked out for me, but it's super important you ask a lot of questions.

Below are a few common questions I would ask.

- What does an average day look like? (This question is incredible. Really helps you understand what you will actually be doing)
- What is <Software Y> I've never heard of before. (If they list some framework on the job posting, ask about it if you're curious)
- Do you have any suggestions for a student trying to stand out in the job hunt?
- What stands out to you in a great employee
- Can you tell me a bit about how you landed your leadership positions and what it entails.(This was a great question to ask people that are managers of teams)

Anyway, you get the point. Asking questions is a must.

## Avoid Getting Discouraged
---

This is perhaps my most important advice. The job hunt sucks. You just have to accept that you are going to be Sisyphus pushing that boulder up a hill. The good thing though is that it will end eventually. No matter how disheartening the process is, you have to stick with it. Don't let a week of zero responses stop you from trying again the next week.

Every single week you need to be doing something towards landing a job. Definitely apply to a minimum 20 jobs a week if you want to maximize your odds. There's about 1,000 other things that will help your odds with landing a job, whether it be Github projects, reading a book on it, Leetcode, editing your resume, preparing for potential interviews, ect. Just dedicate a certain amount of hours each week and work on some of them.

I know it's difficult focusing and dedicating time to things like that when you're already just trying to graduate. I was only doing 9 credit hours my final semester and I felt beaten down. It's super important to stick with it though and stay consistent.

Starting before graduation is one of the best things you can do. I know some people that started from zero after graduation and they're having a ROUGH time. Even if in the worst case you don't land anything before you walk the stage, you're so far ahead of the curve.

Some absolute hooligans land jobs. Even if you're not really qualified for the position, people do not enjoy interviewing and looking for an employee so they might just give up and accept you. This is just to state that anyone graduating with a CS degree is capable of landing a job.


## Miscellaneous Advice
---
This is mostly just advice I would give to people that just landed a position.

- Get your finances figured out. Most people have poor money management skills. Don't be like them. Live below your means to some degree.
- Learn how to invest your money. This is one of those things that will be the smartest choice you ever make and old you will be quite happy. I can't tell you what to invest in (you should open a ROTH IRA though) Just watch a lot of Youtube videos on it and dedicate some amount of money every month to go into investments.
- Reach out to a lot of people for advice. Reaching out to me is smart since I know what I'm talking about. I still reach out to a lot of family, friends, and former bosses for advice.

## Conclusion
---
Sorry if this is an overload of information. Just try to absorb what you can. Since a few people have asked me general job hunting advice, I put almost everything I know into this document.

My upperclassmen had my back so many times and I will never lose my appreciation for what they did so I want to help as much as I can.

Best of Luck!
